# Week 5 part 2

Oh boy... Javascript. How exciting. Anyway notes

## The eloquent notes highlights

- "Computers are dumb, pedantic beasts"
- To tame these beasts, that's why we have programming language, which the book defines as
> "...an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers"
- Javascript has been around since '95 and allows direct interaction with a web page without constantly refreshing.
- Very flexible, but requires you to understand how it works (lol good luck)
- The author isn't going into detail about how it works they are just talking about its history and various versions like EMCAScript

## Mozilla MDN sections

### What is Javascript
- Finally gives examples of Javascript's purpose: "complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc."
- Node.js: allows more functionality to a website, such as connecting multiple computer devices.
- *Client-side* Javascript: Direct browser control, page navigation and inputs.
- *Server-side* Javascript:: Database access, allows users to view or interact with data from a server.

### Javascript vs Java
- Javascript is described as "object-oriented" objects are categorized loosely so inheriting needed objects can get complicated. You can do much more with this, though it isn't automatically saved to the hard drive.
- Java is described as "Class-Based", meaning that objects are structured and organized in various classes inheritance is much easier. Though much more structured
- Java was what the world-famous game Minecraft was coded in Java originally, not in the notes just a fun fact.

### EMCAScript
- Javascript's European standards in basic terms
- EMCAScript has its standardized terminology and syntax.
- not intended to be helpful to script programmers it says....
- I'm going to be real, I do not see the use of this other than more type of code I could write.
